# Commit

On GitHub, **saved changes** are called commits. Each commit has an associated commit message, which is a description explaining why a particular change was made. Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what youâ€™ve done and why.

## Commit & push

Make any change in the code editor and you will notice that an up arrow is displayed
on the **GitHub** button. The arrow means that there are changes are **local**. They stored on your computer and they need to get saved to GitHub. Click on that button to open the **GitHub view**.

The GitHub view contains the [diffs](/github/diff) that represents every **local** change.
If the changes look good, click on **commit & push changes** to create a **commit** and **push** to GitHub. Once the commit is pushed, all your code is safely stored in GitHub!
